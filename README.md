An experiment to see how fast I could make my blog

I decided to learn a bit about the Phalcon framework seen here https://phalconphp.com/en/

According to some tests via Pingdom the website was 100% faster than all tested websites, 91 ms load times recorded https://twitter.com/MarkusTenghamn/status/787729098999230466

I would say the code for the website is really awful and hard to work with. I did everything to make it as fast as possible and paid no attention to ease of use.

Also included is a simple script to import all my posts from my wordpres database and fetch all images.
